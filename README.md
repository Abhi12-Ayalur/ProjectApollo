# ProjectApollo
Designs/docs/software/PCB for Project Apollo (open source oxygen concentrator)

## Why
- Ventilators need oxygen! (typical FiO 0.4 â€¦ 0.9)
- Oxygen generation is a big problem in developing countries. 
  - No established infrastructure. 
  - Oxygen bottles are expensive
- People are already looking at alternative (local) ways for producing oxygen
## What 
- Goal of the Apollo prototype = enabling people around the world to build the prototype as fast as possible
- Focus = Simplicity and speed of build 
- Final goal = Enable people to iterate and publish their own designs in the community
## How
- Follow the published build documentation
- Buy/source the materials (check out the BOM)
- Build the prototype
- Validate O2 concentration and flow. Use a good O2 and flow sensor. 
- Think about risk analysis and assessment: template for Apollo-derived design
- Document and iterate your own design. Publish your findings to the community! 

For more context behind the history/goals/motivation for this project please see our coverage in Helpful Engineering blog:

System Requirements:
Output medical grade Oxygen ideally at 93% or more
Flow rate of 1-20 liters per minute
(5 l/m being standard for oxygen therapy)
